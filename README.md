Here you will find analyzers that help construct a dictionary for Brazilian Portugues.

# Rerverso Verbs

These analyzers are from the reverso website for the 2000 most common portuguese verbs: https://conjugator.reverso.net/conjugation-portuguese-verb-ser.html

The 2000 verbs have been parsed into txt files which are located in diction/input/portverbs250.txt to portverbs2000.txt. These need to be made into an NLP++ dictionary format to be loaded using a 4th analyzer.
